# Side-Menu-With-Delegates
This is a modification of SideMenu from Kyle Lee. In these case I use delegates instead NotificationCenter for acces to the viewControllers from Side Menu and put an extra goBack arrow in the navigtion bar, with a MainViewController as RootViewController of general NavigationController
